### The initial ask

> * Some discussion around in-process analytics  
> * The concept and implementations like DuckDb and Arrow  
> * What the current landscape of options looks like, what is and isn't stable enough for enterprise use  
> * DuckDB backend for dplyr  

* [Hannes MÃ¼hleisen & Mark Raasveldt slides, 2021](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~hannes/sigmod2021-muehleisen-inprocess-slides.pdf)  
* [New directions for Apache Arrow, Wes McKinney 2021-09-13](https://www.slideshare.net/wesm/new-directions-for-apache-arrow)  

---

### The TLDR;

--

#### `arrow`

> `arrow` is software development platform for building high performance applications that process and transport large data sets  

--

* The `arrow` R package is an interface to data via the `arrow` backend, and has upcoming enhanced support for `dplyr`:  
  - Existing ungrouped `mutate()`, `filter()`, `select()` in `arrow` 5.0  
  - `group_by()` + `summarize()` aggregation coming in 6.0  
* `arrow` data can be "handed off" to `duckdb` with `to_duckdb()` for any `dbplyr` commands without data conversion. IE no serialization or data copying costs are incurred.  
  
---

### The TLDR;
  
#### `duckdb`

> DuckDB is a lightweight, columnar oriented, on disk database designed to support **analytical query workloads** and has no external dependencies. It's the '`sqlite` for analytics'  

--

* The `duckdb` R package is an interface to `duckdb` from R  
* It uses postgres 'flavored' SQL with rich support for `dbplyr`  
* It is up to 10x faster than `sqlite` with the same lightweight structure (just a header and the implementation file)  
* It can work with existing on-disk data or interact with `arrow` without any transfer costs  

---

### Working with bigger data?

* Relational databases (IE SQL) are still around and hugely popular but...  

--

* Data and specifically _Local_ files are getting bigger  

--

* Data Warehouses/Data Lakes often use flat-file storage (`.csv`, `.parquet`, `.json` etc)  

--

If the team has a Data Lake (ie semi-structured raw data in CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc) _and_ access to a Data Lake query engine (like Dremio, Athena, Presto, Snowflake, etc), then they should use those tools in R via ODBC  

--

BUT for teams that don't, or have extracts that are still large. How do you work with data that isn't already in a database, and is bigger than your memory?  

---

### Pause for one second

If it _can_ fit in memory, then try out:  

* [`vroom::vroom()`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/) or [`data.table::fread()`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/fread.html) for fast file reads _into_ R  
  * [`vroom(col_select = c(column_name))`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/reference/vroom.html) also allows for partial reads (ie specific columns)  

--

* [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/index.html) or the `dplyr` front-end to `data.table` via [`dtplyr`](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/) for fast and efficient in-memory analysis  

--

* Lastly, the [`collapse`](https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/) R package for limited capability, but hyper-performant data manipulation  

---

### Two topics for today

Two relatively lightweight options:  

* The [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) project  

* [`duckdb`](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r)  

--

* Also, `arrow` can be used to expedite data transfer via  [`sparklyr`](https://spark.rstudio.com/guides/arrow/) to great effect, but that brings into play Java, Scala, and `rJava` `r emo::ji("upside-down")`

## `duckdb`, like sqlite<br>but _really_ fast

<div style = "position: absolute;top: -120px;right: 0;"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1465153690352-10c1b29577f8?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=715&q=80" alt="Two people walking up a large mountain" width="575"></img></div>

---

### [`duckdb`](https://duckdb.org/docs/why_duckdb.html)

> DuckDB plays well with `dbplyr` / `dplyr` for querying from R. - [duckdb.org/docs/api/r](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r)  

--

#### Fast

> DuckDB is designed to support analytical query workloads, also known as Online analytical processing (OLAP). These workloads are characterized by complex, relatively long-running queries that process significant portions of the stored dataset, for example aggregations over entire tables.

--

#### Simple

> DuckDB has no external dependencies, neither for compilation nor during run-time [basically a 10x faster version of SQLite]  

--

#### Feature Rich

> Data can be stored in persistent, single-file databases. DuckDB is deeply integrated into Python and R for efficient interactive data analysis. Use[s] the PostgreSQL parser

### `r fontawesome::fa("check-circle", "#338333")` When to use DuckDB

* Processing and storing tabular datasets, e.g. from CSV or Parquet files  
* **Interactive data analysis**, e.g. Joining & aggregate multiple large tables  
* Concurrent large changes, to multiple large tables, e.g. appending rows, adding/removing/updating columns  
* Large result set transfer to client  

]

### `r fontawesome::fa("times-circle", "red")` When to not use DuckDB

* Non-rectangular data sets, e.g. graphs, plaintext  
* High-volume transactional use cases (e.g. tracking orders in a webshop)  
* Large client/server installations for centralized enterprise data warehousing  
* Writing to a single database from multiple concurrent processes

### `duckdb` + `dbplyr`

`duckdb` uses Postgres-flavored SQL, so it has deep integration with `dbplyr` out of the box.

--

```{r}
library("dplyr", warn.conflicts = FALSE)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb()) # create a temp database in memory
duckdb::duckdb_register(con, "flights", nycflights13::flights)
tbl(con, "flights")
```

---

### `duckdb` + `dbplyr`

`duckdb` uses Postgres-flavored SQL, so it has deep integration with `dbplyr` out of the box.

--

```{r}
tbl(con, "flights") %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_time, na.rm = TRUE))
```


### How big is `nycflights13` anyway?

```{r}
lobstr::obj_size(nycflights13::flights) %>% 
  unclass() %>% 
  scales::label_bytes()(.)
```

--

### Save to disk as a `.csv`

```{r}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  write_delim("flights.csv", delim = ",")
```

--

```{r}
fs::file_info("flights.csv") %>% pull(size)
```


---

### Load into `duckdb` permanently 

```{r}
# write to disk as "flightDisk", other defaults to in memory
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), "flightDisk")

duckdb::duckdb_read_csv(conn = con, name = "flightsCSV",  files = "flights.csv",
                        header = TRUE, delim = ",", na.strings = "NA")
```

--

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(con)
```

---

### Flying with the `duckdb`s

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flight_tbl <- tbl(con, "flightsCSV")
```

### Flying with the `duckdb`s

```{r}
flight_tbl <- tbl(con, "flightsCSV")
flight_tbl

  group_by(month, origin) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_delay)) # all on disk still
```

### `arrow`

> [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming messaging and interprocess communication.

--

> The `arrow` package exposes an interface to the Arrow C++ library, enabling access to many of its features in R. It provides low-level access to the Arrow C++ library API and higher-level access through a `dplyr` backend and familiar R functions.  

--

For more info, checkout the slides from Wes McKinney as of [September 10th](https://www.slideshare.net/wesm/new-directions-for-apache-arrow)  

---

### `arrow` and `duckdb` integration

```{r}
arrow::InMemoryDataset$create(mtcars) %>%
  filter(mpg < 30) %>%
  arrow::to_duckdb() %>% # oneliner to move into duckdb
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

### Big data

ok... so `mtcars` is most definitely not big data.

--

And ~30 Mb of `nycflights.csv` is not that impressive. 

--

Let's use the `arrow` example data, stay in NYC, and look at the `nyc-taxi` fare dataset

--

```{r fareAndSize}
nyc_fares <- fs::dir_info("nyc-taxi", recurse = TRUE) %>%
  filter(type == "file") %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), size = sum(size)) 

glue::glue("There are {nyc_fares$n} files, totaling {nyc_fares$size}!")
```

--

Now that we have a full quiver of data to pull from, let's shoot some `arrow`s

--

Also RIP my laptop's hard drive space `r emo::ji("bomb")` `r emo::ji("boom")` `r emo::ji("bomb")`

---

### Shoot some `arrow`s

Benchmarked with R 4.1.1 on a Macbook Pro 2017 (2.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5) with 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 and 256 GB SSD

```{r startArrow}
library(duckdb)
library(pins)
library(arrow, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(tictoc) # for timing

# arrow::arrow_with_s3()
# setwd("/Volumes/mock-external/")
# arrow::copy_files("s3://ursa-labs-taxi-data", "nyc-taxi")
# warning that downloads 37Gb of data!


tic()
ds <- open_dataset("nyc-taxi", partitioning = c("year", "month"))
toc() # just to show that this is a fast process
```

---

### How many ar**rows**?

```{r ludicrousSpeed, cache = TRUE}
tic()
full_collect <- summarise(ds, n = n()) %>%

                      accuracy = 0.01)(full_collect)

### How can you query 1.5 BILLION rows in a few seconds?

> Apache Arrow processes large amounts of data quickly by using Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD). Sets of data are broken into batches that fit the cache layers of a CPU. - [Apache Arrow overview from OmniSci](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/apache-arrow)  

--

`arrow` provides an R interface to `feather` and `parquet`, along with more traditional formats (CSV, JSON, RDS). It also provides a translation of `dplyr` into `dbplyr`-style queries OUT of memory.

--

`arrow` is a columnar data format, as opposed to more traditional storage that is row-based.

--

With row-based, when `filter()` or `select()`, the query engine would have to scan every row, parse each column, extract the specified matches and then perform calculations

--

With columnar formats, you can completely skip unnecessary columns, and even for a relatively "narrow" dataset of 6x columns, this means 1/6th the processing... or essentially a 600% performance gain. You can imagine the performance gains when you have wide data with dozens of additional columns that are only needed intermittently.

---

### How can you query 1.5 BILLION rows in a few seconds?

---

### How can you query ~~1.5 BILLION rows~~ in a few seconds?

The answer? By **not** reading in 1.5 billion rows.

--

`arrow`'s 'magic', is that `filter()` + `select()` + columnar data format are "cheat codes" for ludicrously fast subset queries. BUT it's also very optimized, and simply reading in entire files or entire columns is also very fast. [Neal Richardson, NYR 2020](https://enpiar.com/talks/nyr-2020/#41)

--

```{r NYRSlides, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://enpiar.com/talks/nyr-2020/img/taxi-single-1.png")
```

---

### One more piece of "magic"

`arrow` and `arrow::open_dataset()` allows for the creation and reading of partitioned datasets. The `nyc-taxi` data is _actually_ 126 individual parquet files. Each file is about 300 Mb. 

--

This allows for "touching" only the necessary subsets, rather than searching the entire combined dataset.

--

```{r}
ds <- open_dataset("nyc-taxi", partitioning = c("year", "month"))
```


--

```{r}
fs::dir_ls("nyc-taxi/", recurse = TRUE) %>%  
  stringr::str_subset("parquet", negate = TRUE) %>% 
  stringr::str_subset("\\/20[0-9]+\\/") %T>% 
  {cat("There are", length(.), "files\n")} %>% return()
```


---

### Big data, new data

.left-wide[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tic()
ds %>%
  filter(total_amount > 100, year == 2015) %>%
  select(tip_amount, total_amount, passenger_count) %>%

### Big data, all the rows

--

### Big data, elsewhere

Same data, but on a cheap 4TB hard drive, 5400 RPM, connected via USB 2.0.

### We can shoot ducks with arrows

Going back to local SSD and using `arrow::to_duckdb()`, note the full `group_by()`/`mutate()` support!

--

.left-wide[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tic()
ds %>%
  filter(total_amount > 100, year == 2015) %>%
  select(tip_amount, total_amount, passenger_count) %>%
  # use arrow to populate directly into a duckdb
  arrow::to_duckdb() %>% 
  group_by(passenger_count) %>%  # group_by mutate!
  mutate(tip_pct = 100 * tip_amount / total_amount) %>%
  filter(tip_pct >= 25) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% collect()
toc()
```

]

--

.right-narrow[
```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
tic()
ds %>%
  filter(total_amount > 100, year == 2015) %>%
  select(tip_amount, total_amount, passenger_count) %>%
  # use arrow to populate directly into a duckdb
  arrow::to_duckdb() %>% 
  group_by(passenger_count) %>%  # group_by mutate!
  mutate(tip_pct = 100 * tip_amount / total_amount) %>%
  filter(tip_pct >= 25) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% collect()
toc()
```
]

---

### `pins`

Now, as far as using `arrow`, since they are single files (eg `feather` or `parquet`), you _could_ `pin` them

--

Note, `pins` 1.0 now has native support for `feather` which is essentially an `arrow` dataframe on disk.

--

`duckdb` is two files, but you should just use `feather` anyway as it's fast to read, relatively efficient to store, and allows you to mix `arrow` native work along with `arrow::to_duckdb()` if you need `duckdb` querying.

--

You could also go `parquet` which is very efficient to store and fast to read. In `pins` you would switch from `pin_write()` to `pin_upload()`/`pin_download() %>% arrow::read_parquet()` since it's treated as a file rather than one of the native `read` file types.

---

### `pins` comparison

.pull-left[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
query_feather <- function(){
  tic()
  feather_file <- pin_download(
    board_rsc, 
    "thomas/big-nyc-feather")
  
  feather_file <- arrow::open_dataset(
    feather_file, format = "feather")
  
  summary_feather <- feather_file %>% 
    select(fare_amount, vendor_id) %>% 
    filter(vendor_id == "1") %>% 
    summarise(mean = mean(fare_amount)) %>% 
    collect()

  toc()
}
```


]

--

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
query_rds <- function(){
  
  tic()
  
  pinned_rds <- pin_download(
    board_rsc, 
    "thomas/big-nyc-rds")
  
  rds_file <- readr::read_rds(pinned_rds)
  
  summary_rds <- rds_file %>% 
    select(fare_amount, vendor_id) %>% 
    filter(vendor_id == "1") %>% 
    summarise(mean = mean(fare_amount))
  
  toc()
}
```

]


---

### `pins` comparison

`feather` is native to `arrow`, so it allows for rapid file reading AND allows for partial reading, through a combination of `filter()` + `select()` + `summarize()`

--

So, `pins` + `feather` + `arrow::open_dataset()` allows for insanely fast queries on relatively large datasets.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
query_feather()
#> 10.2 sec elapsed
query_rds()
#> 14.4 sec elapsed
```

--

I promised you speed, but they're the same! You can't "beat" download times `r emo::ji("shrug")`


---

### `pins` comparison

While you can't beat file transfer, disk space is **infinitely** cheaper than memory...

--

And your downloaded file still exists!

```{r}
file.exists("~/Library/Caches/pins/rsc-e62371cfd77db754024f9c5ed3556a73/2f2ee2e3-564a-4791-a7f3-01e22ad2939f/48597/big-nyc-feather.arrow")
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Windowed query
query_feather()
#> 0.554 sec elapsed

# read ENTIRE file in
query_rds()
#> 11.8 sec elapsed
```

---

### `pins` comparison

Now, you could get similar query speed ups by loading the data completely into memory 1x, but you'd have to "eat" the initial read time of 10+ seconds.

--

Also... now you're lugging around at least 1 Gb of data for each session... and there are _very few times_ when all of your users **needs** 1 Gb of data all at once.

--

By selecting "windows" of data rapidly, you get the ability to perform useful queries/summaries across large swaths of data with minimal memory load, and minimal read time.

---

### `pins` comparison

So, in your `shiny` apps:

### `pins` + `duckdb`

Cached file still exists, so can be used with `duckdb` as well!

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tic()
feather_file <- pin_download(board_rsc, "thomas/big-nyc-feather")

feather_file <- arrow::open_dataset(feather_file, format = "feather")

summary_duck <- feather_file %>%
  select(fare_amount, vendor_id) %>%
  filter(vendor_id == "1") %>%
  arrow::to_duckdb() %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(fare_amount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  collect()
toc()
#> 1.48 sec
```

### Pause for a second

While it's possible to have these work with `shiny` or interactive apps via `pins`, again I think it's worth considering `shiny` apps as **requiring** a proper database if working with that much data.

---

### Keeping your `pins` at a distance

If your team happens to use AWS, you can make use of [native S3 support with `arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html)  

--

Similar to our `pins` workflow, there is unavoidable file-transfer time BUT you can read the files remotely and you _can_ partition the data in S3.

--

This allows `arrow` to intelligently transfer/read only portions of the partitions as necessary, optimizing both the file transfer AND the query/read.

---

### Things we didn't talk about

* Snowflake (uses `arrow` under the hood)  

--

* Dremio (uses `arrow` under the hood)  

--

* Rinse and repeat across many other databases/data warehouse engines, as `arrow` is quickly becoming a standard tool for lots of database/data warehouse/data lake providers  

--

The core idea is if you have a "real" data warehouse or data lake, your team has likely already invested in some way to perform queries (and you can probably just use ODBC or equivalent).

--

BUT if you have a need to work with large flat-files, whether extracted from your data warehouse or other methods, `arrow` and/or `duckdb` are very attractive tools.

--

`pins` can be leveraged along with `arrow`, but you lose a lot of the power of partitioning, since it's a single file. That being said, with `shiny` app sized data, you should be more than fine with a single file.

---

### Should you use `arrow` with `shiny`?

* If you are relying on CSVs today, sure `parquet` is an efficient storage format, meaning it will be "cheaper" to move around and faster to read, and can still be used via `pins`  

--

* BUT should you move around 1 Gb flat files for `shiny` apps with _many_ users? Probably not.  

--

* Could it be useful for large-data `shiny` apps with low user counts? `r emo::ji("shrug")` Possibly but not necessarily something I'm keen on suggesting as 'ideal'   

--

* But this requires you passing around a large flat file, and typically a dedicated database table will be a better option

---

### Using a dedicated database, aka 3 Tier Architecture

* **Presentation Tier:** Javascript/HTML/CSS, ie Front-end, processed in client browser  


* **Application/Logic Tier:** R/Python, processed in memory, meaning `shiny`/`dash`/`streamlit` OR connections to `plumber`/`flask`/`FastAPI`, ie it can include "microservices" or be a "monolith"  

* **Data Tier:** Database/SQL/etc, processed in the database backend

### Summary

- For both R/Python, `arrow` and/or `DuckDB` can make working with _larger_ out of memory data possible and much faster for interactive work  

--

- `arrow` alone can push `filter()`/`select()` calls _into_ the data, along with basic `group_by()`:  `mutate()` + `summarize()` to data on disk  

--

- `duckdb` further adds full `dbplyr` support, and can be used with native `arrow` BUT it doesn't _require_ `arrow` in the process. Could be a standalone local database on disk.  

--

- If you use `pins`, you can _also_ use `arrow` via `parquet`/`feather` for lightweight files, fast full or partial reads  

--

- `arrow` + `duckdb` with large data are likely not appropriate for high-concurrency `shiny` apps  

--

- Large datasets with potentially high concurrency is where a database (and `dbplyr`) makes sense, and maybe that database is columnar/uses `arrow` behind the scenes!
